Relevant updates details

---

## __2.4.0__
⚠️ The __*cursor*__ module is no longer enabled by default on touch events. Look at [module documentation](./cursor/README.md) to learn more.

## __2.3.0__
⚠️ The __*detect*__ module has been removed and will no longer be supported as it was actually a simple wrapper of [ua-parser-js](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js) and [ismobilejs](https://github.com/kaimallea/isMobile). If required, please use them directly.
